To use this neural network :
1. You can use the ImageClassifier.ipynb (jupyter notebook). You can run it locally by modifying the layers to have flexibility and learning.
2. There's a precompiled model. The name of structure of model is mod_struct.json and the weights of model are stored by the name fmnist_weights.h5
  To load the model -->
  ----use "model_from_json()", " load_weights()" under keras.models module, "Path()" from pathlib,
  [[ f=Path("<The absolute path of the mod_structure.json on local machine>")
     model_text=f.read_text()
     model_structure=model_from_json(model_text) 
     model.load_weights("<The absolute path of model_weights.h5 on local machine")
  ]]
