# Fashion_MNIST
This is image classification neural network on Fashion MNIST dataset by keras
We used the Keras front-end with Tensorflow performing the actual tasks.

The neural network that is used in the project uses reLu(Rectified linear unit) and Softmax activation functions
The loss function or error function used is "sparse_categorical_entropy"
The optimizer used id "sgd"

This repo serves as a good begining step into the Deep Learning
